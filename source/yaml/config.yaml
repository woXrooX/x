  # In the initial attempt, the application seeks to retrieve the user's selected language in case of a logged-in session.
  # Subsequently, on the second attempt, it endeavors to retrieve the cached language settings.
  # As part of the third step, the application makes attempts to acquire the language code associated with the current geographical location.
  # Finally, should all prior attempts prove unsuccessful, the application gracefully defaults to a fallback language.
  # In the event that no matching language is found within the "language_dictionary.json" file, the application will once again resort to utilizing the fallback language.
  # Even in the scenario where the fallback language yields no corresponding results within the "language_dictionary.json" file, the application will proceed to display the unprocessed keywords that were employed in the call to window.Language.use(KEYWORD).
